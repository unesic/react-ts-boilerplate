# React TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate to get started with React TS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run all of the standard react scripts plus:

### `npm run watch:css`

Runs tailwind CSS watcher inside `src/assets` directory.
Styles are automatically re-compiled to `app.css` file.
Refreshing isn't necessary as the style changes will reflect on file save.

### `npm run build:opt`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
Instead of spitting out multiple files, it produces a single JavaScript and CSS file.
